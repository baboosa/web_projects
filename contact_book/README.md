# Agenda Project - README

This project is a contact book application designed to reflect my backend evolution. In it I implemented a CRUD system using the NoSQL MongoDB database. The application allows users to perform basic contact management operations such as creating, editing, deleting and viewing information.

## Features

- User authentication: login and registration.
- Full CRUD for contact management.
- Use of functions, classes, and constructors for code organization.
- Use of libraries such as dotenv, bcrypt.js, express, validator, and webpack.
